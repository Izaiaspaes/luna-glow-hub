    "a1": "Yes! Privacy is our top priority. All your data is encrypted and stored securely. You have full control over your information and can export or delete your data at any time. We never share your personal information without your explicit consent.",
    "q2": "How does Luna's Artificial Intelligence work?",
    "a2": "Our AI analyzes your tracking data (cycle, sleep, mood, and energy) to identify unique patterns in your body. Based on these analyses, it generates personalized Wellness Plans with practical and actionable recommendations, specifically tailored for you. The more you use it, the more accurate the recommendations become.",
    "q3": "What's the difference between Plans and Wellness Plans?",
    "a3": "Plans are our subscription tiers (Free and Premium) that define which features you have access to. Wellness Plans are the personalized recommendations generated by our AI based on your tracking data, such as sleep routines, nutritional tips, and exercises.",
    "q4": "What's included in the Free Plan?",
    "a4": "The Free Plan includes basic tracking for cycle, sleep, mood, and energy, access to the AI assistant with limited responses, data visualization in simple graphs, and basic notifications. It's perfect for starting to better understand your body and routine.",
    "q5": "How does voice transcription work?",
    "a5": "Voice transcription is only available in the Premium Plan and allows you to record your tracking information by speaking instead of typing. Our AI automatically transcribes your speech and analyzes the content to fill in fields and generate personalized insights.",
    "q6": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
    "a6": "Yes, you can cancel your Premium subscription at any time without additional costs. Your data will remain secure and you'll continue to have access to Free Plan features. There's no commitment period or cancellation fees.",
